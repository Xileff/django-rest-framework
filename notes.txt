Project
If you’re wondering the difference between a project and an app. A project is a Django web application, it can consist of one or more apps. It’s the folder holding manage.py and the other module that includes the settings.py and other files. An app is a python package that does a certain feature, includes files like models.py, the migration directory and more

The startproject will create the main project directory, while the startapp will create the app directory. Both are also been passed a name to be used in generation. The startproject is the first command run when creating a new project, while the startapp is run inside the new project directory.
